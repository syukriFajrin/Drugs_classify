# Build Desicion Tree Model
---
## Overview
---
This project aims to predict type Drug based on their variabels using a Desicion Tree model.

---
## Objectives
---
* Perform data scaling  
* Conduct Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
* Build a Linear Regression model  
* Provide insights based on the results  

---
## Dataset
---
The dataset contains 1 feature and 1 target variable:
* age            
* sex            
* bp             
* cholesterol    
* na_to_k        
* drug(target)
